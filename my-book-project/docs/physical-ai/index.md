## What is Physical AI?

Physical AI combines traditional AI techniques with physical systems, enabling machines to perceive, reason, and act in the physical world. Unlike traditional AI that primarily processes digital information, Physical AI systems must navigate the complexities of real-world physics, sensor noise, and actuator limitations.

### Key Characteristics

- **Embodied Intelligence**: Intelligence emerges from the interaction between AI algorithms and physical bodies
- **Real-time Processing**: Systems must respond to environmental changes within strict timing constraints
- **Uncertainty Management**: Dealing with sensor noise, actuator errors, and environmental variability
- **Multi-modal Perception**: Integration of visual, tactile, auditory, and other sensory inputs

## Applications of Physical AI

Physical AI has numerous applications across various domains:

- Robotics and automation
- Autonomous vehicles
- Smart manufacturing
- Healthcare and assistive technologies
- Environmental monitoring
