## Vision
To create an accessible and engaging resource that demystifies Physical AI, empowering beginners to intermediate learners with practical knowledge and hands-on experience to build intelligent physical systems.

## Core Principles

### I. Hands-on Learning
Every concept must be accompanied by practical, runnable code examples. Readers learn by doing, actively engaging with the material.

### II. Clear and Concise Explanations
Content should be easily understandable for beginners to intermediate learners, avoiding jargon where possible and explaining complex topics clearly and concisely.

### III. Practical Application
The book will emphasize real-world applications of Physical AI concepts, demonstrating how theoretical knowledge translates into practical solutions.

### IV. Docusaurus for Documentation
The book's content will be structured and managed using Docusaurus, leveraging its features for clear navigation, searchability, and maintainability.

## Success Criteria
- High reader engagement through practical examples.
- Positive feedback from target audience on clarity and usefulness.
- Measurable increase in reader's ability to implement Physical AI concepts.
- Easy navigation and searchability of content within the Docusaurus platform.

## Constraints
- **Target Audience:** Beginners to intermediate learners.
- **Tech Stack:** Docusaurus for documentation.
- **Content Focus:** Hands-on learning with practical examples.
- **Scope:** Focused on core Physical AI concepts and their practical implementation.

## Stakeholders
- Authors/Contributors
- Readers (beginners to intermediate in AI/robotics)
- Technical Reviewers
- Docusaurus Community (indirectly, for tooling support)

## Brand Voice
Informative, encouraging, clear, and technically accurate. The tone should be approachable and supportive, fostering a learning environment that builds confidence in readers.

## Governance
All changes to the constitution must be reviewed and approved by the core team. Amendments will follow a strict versioning policy, with major, minor, and patch increments for significant, additive, and corrective changes respectively.
