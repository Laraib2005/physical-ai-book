## Gates *(mandatory)*

### Phase 0: Outline & Research

**Goal**: Establish the foundational structure and research critical components.

#### Research Tasks

No specific research tasks identified as critical blockers for initial planning, as the request is for a development plan outline. All necessary components are defined at a high level. However, during the content creation phase, specific research will be required for detailed examples and explanations of each technology.

#### Technical Decisions & Rationale

**1. Docusaurus Version**: Docusaurus 3+
   *   **Rationale**: To leverage the latest features, performance improvements, and long-term support, ensuring a modern and extensible documentation platform.
   *   **Alternatives Considered**: Docusaurus 2 (older, less features), custom static site generator (higher development overhead, more maintenance).

**2. Deployment Platform**: GitHub Pages or Vercel
   *   **Rationale**: Both offer excellent static site hosting, robust CI/CD integration, and cost-effectiveness for open-source projects. The user specified both as acceptable options.
   *   **Alternatives Considered**: Netlify (similar to Vercel), self-hosting (more complex setup and maintenance).

### Phase 1: Design & Contracts

**Goal**: Design the Docusaurus setup, content development phases, and file structure for the textbook.

#### Docusaurus Setup Steps and Configuration

1.  **Initialize Docusaurus Project**:
    *   Ensure Node.js (LTS) is installed on the development machine.
    *   Execute `npx create-docusaurus@latest my-book-project classic` in the desired project directory.
    *   Select a preferred package manager (npm or yarn) when prompted.
2.  **Basic Configuration (`docusaurus.config.js`)**:
    *   Populate `title` (e.g., "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics"), `tagline`, `url`, `baseUrl`, and `favicon` paths.
    *   Configure `presets` for `@docusaurus/preset-classic` to enable documentation, blog (optional), and theme functionalities.
3.  **Sidebar Navigation (`sidebars.js`)**:
    *   Define the hierarchical structure of the book's navigation. Chapters will be top-level categories, with lessons as individual items within each category.
    *   Example: `docs: [{ type: 'autogenerated', dirName: '.' }]` for auto-generation, or explicit definition for finer control.
4.  **Theme Customization**:
    *   Adjust `docusaurus.config.js` `themeConfig` for aesthetic elements like `navbar`, `footer`, and `colorMode`.
    *   Create custom CSS rules in `src/css/custom.css` to align with the book's branding and visual identity.
5.  **Search Integration**:
    *   Integrate Docusaurus built-in Algolia DocSearch for comprehensive full-text search capabilities across the book content.
6.  **Deployment Configuration**:
    *   Configure `docusaurus.config.js` for deployment to GitHub Pages (utilizing `docusaurus deploy` command and GitHub Actions for CI/CD) or Vercel (configuring `vercel.json` and Vercel's CI/CD integration).

#### Content Development Phases

1.  **Phase 1: Outline & Chapter Structure**:
    *   Define high-level topics covering Physical AI, ROS 2, Gazebo, Unity, Isaac Sim, VLA, and humanoid robotics, ensuring comprehensive coverage as per the book scope.
    *   Create a detailed chapter list, with each chapter clearly articulating its specific learning outcomes.
    *   Establish a logical, progressive hierarchical structure for lessons within each chapter to guide learners effectively.
2.  **Phase 2: Core Content Creation**:
    *   Develop initial drafts for all chapters and lessons using Markdown (`.md` or `.mdx` for React components).
    *   Embed practical, runnable code examples (e.g., Python, ROS 2 code snippets) directly within the content to support hands-on learning.
    *   Integrate relevant diagrams, images, videos, and other multimedia elements to enhance understanding and engagement.
3.  **Phase 3: RAG Chatbot Integration**:
    *   Design and develop the FastAPI backend for the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot, handling requests and orchestrating interactions with external services.
    *   Integrate Qdrant as the vector database for efficient semantic search of book content, Neon for PostgreSQL for data persistence, and OpenAI Agents for advanced conversational AI capabilities.
    *   Develop a custom React component to embed the chatbot interface seamlessly into the Docusaurus frontend.
4.  **Phase 4: User Authentication & Personalization**:
    *   Implement user Signup/Signin functionality leveraging the Better-Auth framework for secure authentication.
    *   Develop a "Personalization button" per chapter that allows authenticated users to tailor content (e.g., adjust difficulty, select preferred examples, save progress). This will require backend services to store and retrieve user preferences.
5.  **Phase 5: Translation Integration**:
    *   Implement an "Urdu translation button" per chapter. This feature will likely utilize Docusaurus's built-in i18n capabilities or integrate with a custom translation API, providing dynamic language switching.
6.  **Phase 6: Bonus: Claude Code Subagents & Skills**:
    *   Research and integrate specific Claude Code Subagents and Skills that can enhance the book's interactive learning experience or provide development assistance directly within the content (e.g., code explanation, debugging help).
7.  **Phase 7: Review & Refinement**:
    *   Conduct rigorous technical reviews of all content, code examples, and implemented features to ensure accuracy, best practices, and functionality.
    *   Perform comprehensive linguistic reviews for clarity, grammar, tone, and overall readability.
    *   Implement user testing sessions to gather feedback on usability, learning effectiveness, and overall user satisfaction, iterating on the design as needed.

**Structure Decision**: The chosen structure is a single Docusaurus project (`my-book-project/`) with a clear separation of documentation (`docs/`), custom components (`src/components/`), and static assets (`static/`). Chapters are organized into subdirectories within `docs/`, each with an `index.md` for overview and separate markdown files for individual lessons, along with `_category_.json` for Docusaurus sidebar generation. This structure promotes modularity, maintainability, and aligns with Docusaurus best practices.

### Phase 2: Refinement & Validation

**Goal**: Validate the architectural plan against the specification and constitution.

#### Agent Context Update

*   Run `.specify/scripts/powershell/update-agent-context.ps1 -AgentType claude` after this phase to update the agent's context with new technologies and architectural decisions, ensuring future interactions are informed by the plan.

#### Constitution Re-evaluation

This plan continues to adhere to the constitution's principles:
*   **Hands-on Learning**: The detailed content development phases explicitly include incorporating runnable code examples and practical demonstrations within each chapter.
*   **Clear and Concise Explanations**: The structured file organization, planned lesson breakdown, and review phases are designed to ensure content clarity and conciseness for the target audience.
*   **Practical Application**: The chosen technologies (ROS 2, Gazebo, Unity, Isaac Sim, VLA, Humanoid Robotics) and their integration within the content directly support practical application of Physical AI concepts.
*   **Docusaurus for Documentation**: Docusaurus remains the foundational platform, with its setup, configuration, and content structure explicitly defined to maximize its documentation capabilities.

## Follow-ups and Risks

*   **Follow-up**: Detailed design for the RAG chatbot's specific models, API contracts, and data ingestion pipeline for Qdrant, including chunking strategies for the book content.
*   **Follow-up**: Research into specific libraries/frameworks for chapter-wise personalization (e.g., user preference storage, dynamic content rendering) and Urdu translation (e.g., i18n libraries, external translation services beyond Docusaurus's core capabilities).
*   **Risk**: The complexity of integrating multiple external services (FastAPI, Qdrant, Neon, OpenAI, Better-Auth) might lead to unforeseen integration challenges, increased development time, and potential performance bottlenecks.
*   **Risk**: Ensuring Docusaurus can be extended gracefully to accommodate the interactive features (RAG chatbot, personalization, translation buttons) without compromising core functionality, performance, or long-term maintainability.
*   **Risk**: The extensive scope of content creation across all specified topics (Physical AI, ROS 2, Gazebo, Unity, Isaac Sim, VLA, Humanoid Robotics) represents a significant effort and requires careful project management to maintain consistency, technical accuracy, and quality throughout the book.
